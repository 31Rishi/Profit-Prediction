Also created a working web app for live prediction of profit if the user enters R&D spend, admin cost and marketing as well as can enter personal csv file to calculate the profit and also it shows the outliers and the most important feature.

STEP 1: Install python libraries: pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib joblib
STEP 2: Train the Model + Generate Feature Importance: python train_model.py
STEP 3: Generate Outlier Plot: python evaluation.py
STEP 4:Run the Flask Web App: python app.py
STEP 5:Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
